# Active Carbon Kiln
This is the code for my active carbon kiln project.

- "EX27_no_preheat.ino" is the final arduino file used for the main controller
- "Project_main.c" is the program for the conveying scale
- "Project(CAVR file).prj" is the CodevisionAVR file format of the "Project_main.c"
- "test0.xls" is the Excel file for receiving data from the min controller

This kiln makes active carbon from pistachio crusts. Pistachio crusts enter from one side, hot air and mist enter from the other side, a chemical reaction occurs, and active carbon powder is created. I did the Electrical part of this kiln.

The whole setup was made to optimize the conditions of the chemical reaction. A separate weighting conveyor unit calculates the crust's mass/time that sends the data to the central controller. The entire data is sent to a computer and can be viewed live from Excel.
Main Features:

  - Controllable Temperature

  - Controllable Mist amount

  - Controllable Feeding rate

  - Controllable Rotation speed

  - Measured Exhausted gas 

  - All parameters and data are sent to Excel

This is the whole Kiln structure. Pistachio crusts are fed through the hopper (right side of the kiln) and moved to the kiln with a screw conveyor. The kiln itself rotates slowly with a wheelchair motor and some belt-gear transmitters. By having a slight angle and rotation, crusts are moved slowly to the left side(end of the kiln). 

Heat and water mist are generated by a combustion heater(methane gas) and three ultrasonic piezoelectrics respectively on the left side.

There is a double-sided cylinder in the middle of the kiln. The Hot air and mist move inside the cylinder to the right side and travel back to the left side, and exit.

The active carbon powder made from the crusts moves to a long pipe floating inside a polymer, bigger pipe filled with water to cool down and then exits to the small weighing conveyor.
